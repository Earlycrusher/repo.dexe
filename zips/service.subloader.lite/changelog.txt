SubLoader Lite Changelog
------------------------

0.1.8	(24.05.2024)
- Changed addon name and addon id
- Cosmetic changes and some small fixes
- For now only English translation
- Option to add subtitle search dialog contextmenu button to context menu (on by default), so you can use the subtitles dialog also when kodi is not playing. You can use when focusing on an item and it will automatically check it for you without typing or just using the manual search button to check if subtitles exist. Only supported by OpenSubtitles Plus (OpenSubtitles.com) and OpenSubtitles.org by OpenSubtitles with dual subs addon. If you have Subtitles Dialog - Contextmenu (context.subtitlesdialog.contextmenu) addon by burekas installed, remove it.
- Removed module and functionality for automatic search and download of subtitles from opensubtitles.org

0.1.7	(23.11.2022)
- G-Mod changes removed
- fix/extend exclude pvr (peno64)
- patch to function videosource() to returns the stream url if it is a .strm file, that way it can detect the addon used to open the file/url and can use the addons exclusions (helviojr)
