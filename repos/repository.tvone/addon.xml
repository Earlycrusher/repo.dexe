    <summary>All the working tvOne add-ons</summary>
    <description>This is a simple repo for all of RACC's tvOne IPTV add-ons (Kodi 19 and up)[CR]After seeing so many versions and forks out there I wanted to provide a location for the original latest updated versions. These are taken directly from RACC's Japanese Repository and slightly modified with an icon, fanart and a date updated tag in the description. Developers are welcome to import this into their own repos.
